## Introduction
Polynomial spline regression is a flexible and powerful technique used for fitting a smooth curve to data points. It's particularly useful when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is nonlinear. This documentation will guide you through the steps of implementing polynomial spline regression.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding Polynomial Splines
- Polynomial splines are piecewise polynomials that are connected smoothly at specific points called knots.
- Each piece of the spline is defined by a polynomial function within a specific interval.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Collect your dataset consisting of independent (input) and dependent (output) variables.

### 3. Selecting Knots
- Choose the locations where the polynomials will join together, known as knots.
- These knots can be evenly spaced or based on the distribution of your data.
- The number and placement of knots significantly impact the flexibility and accuracy of the spline (more knots ~ more complex).

### 4. Constructing Polynomial Pieces
- Within each interval defined by the knots, fit a polynomial function to the data.
- The degree of the polynomial determines the flexibility of the spline (higer degree ~ more complex). Common choices include linear (degree 1), quadratic (degree 2), or cubic (degree 3) polynomials.

### 5. Assembling the Spline
- Combine the polynomial pieces together to form the spline.

### 6. Fitting the Spline
- Use regression techniques to estimate the coefficients of the polynomial pieces.
- This involves solving a system of equations to find the optimal parameters that minimize the error between the observed data and the fitted spline.

## Conclusion
Polynomial spline regression offers a flexible approach to modeling nonlinear relationships in data. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can effectively implement and interpret polynomial spline regression models for your own datasets. Experiment with different knot placements and polynomial degrees to find the best-fitting spline for your data.
